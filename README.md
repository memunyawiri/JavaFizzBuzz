FizzBuzz README

## FizzBuzz in Java

My TDD attempt at the FizzBuzz kata in Java testing with JUnit.

## Rule of Fizzbuzz:

Fizzbuzz has the following specification:
* The program can be passed a number.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, it returns the message "Fizz".
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, it returns the message "Buzz".
* When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it ignores the previous two rules and returns the message "Fizzbuzz".
* In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.
